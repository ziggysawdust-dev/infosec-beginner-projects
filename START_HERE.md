### Talking Points for Each Project

**Project 1 - Password Checker**
> "I built a password strength validator using regex to check security criteria. This shows I understand NIST guidelines and can implement real security requirements."

**Project 2 - Hash Generator**
> "I implemented hashing with multiple algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512) to demonstrate understanding of cryptographic fundamentals and why different algorithms exist."

**Project 3 - Ciphers**
> "I implemented both Caesar and Vigenère ciphers plus brute force attacks. This shows I understand encryption basics and why classical ciphers are insecure for modern use."

**Project 4 - Port Scanner**
> "I built a network scanner with threading for performance. This demonstrates networking knowledge and that I understand the importance of only scanning authorized systems."

**Project 5 - Password Manager**
> "I created an encrypted password manager using AES and PBKDF2 key derivation. This shows advanced cryptography knowledge and secure software design principles."
