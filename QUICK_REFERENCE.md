## Interview Questions & Answers

**Q: Tell me about your projects**
> A: I built 5 security projects in Python: password strength checker, hash generator, encryption ciphers, port scanner, and password manager. Each demonstrates specific security concepts from regex validation to AES encryption.

**Q: What security concepts did you learn?**
> A: Input validation, cryptographic hashing (MD5/SHA), classical encryption (Caesar/Vigenère), network programming with sockets, threading, AES encryption, PBKDF2 key derivation, and secure random generation.

**Q: Why are these projects important?**
> A: They demonstrate practical security understanding - how to validate input, store credentials securely, understand encryption, and scan networks responsibly. Each builds on the previous knowledge.
